/*
  One open application per person: re-applying while a decision is outstanding
  would give an admin two records saying the same thing. Partial, so a decided
  application never blocks the next one.

  `userId` must NOT also carry `index: true` on its path. Mongoose would emit
  both definitions, the plain one would take the auto-generated name `userId_1`
  first, and MongoDB then refuses this one with IndexKeySpecsConflict — same
  name, different spec. That is not a dropped option but an index that is never
  created at all, leaving nothing but an application-level findOne that two
  concurrent requests can both pass. It boots with a warning either way, in a
  line that scrolls past among the startup logs.

  index-integrity.check.mjs builds these for real and tries to insert the second
  application, so the next person to add `index: true` to a path finds out here.
